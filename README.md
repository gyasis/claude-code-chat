## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- **VS Code 1.80+** - Latest version recommended
- **Claude Code CLI** - [Install from Anthropic](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Active Claude API or subscription** - API or Pro/Max plan

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from VS Code Marketplace (Original Version)
```
ext install claude-code-chat
```

#### Option 2: Install from This Fork (Includes NVM Integration & MCP Sync)
Since this is a fork with advanced MCP integration, agent color coding, and enhanced features, you'll need to build and install it manually:

1. **Clone and build the extension**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gyasis/claude-code-chat.git
   cd claude-code-chat
   npm install
   npm run compile
   npx @vscode/vsce package
   ```
   This will create `claude-code-chat-sam-1.1.1.vsix` in the project directory.

2. **Install the VSIX**:
   - **Method A**: In VS Code, go to Extensions ‚Üí "..." ‚Üí "Install from VSIX" ‚Üí Select the `.vsix` file
   - **Method B**: Command line: `code --install-extension claude-code-chat-sam-1.1.1.vsix`
   - **Method C**: Drag and drop the `.vsix` file into VS Code

3. **Configure NVM Integration** (Optional but Recommended):
   - Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
   - Search for "Claude Code Chat"
   - Enable "NVM Integration for terminal commands"
   - Set "NVM version to use in terminals" to your preferred version (e.g., "22.9.0")

#### Option 3: Use the Installation Script (Easiest)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gyasis/claude-code-chat.git
cd claude-code-chat
./install.sh
```
This script will automatically build the VSIX file and install it for you.

#### Option 4: Build from Source (Detailed Steps)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gyasis/claude-code-chat.git
cd claude-code-chat

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run compile

# 4. Package into VSIX file
npx @vscode/vsce package

# 5. Install the generated VSIX file
code --install-extension claude-code-chat-1.0.5.vsix
```

3. **Open Claude Code Chat**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` (or `Cmd+Shift+C` on Mac)
   - Or click the Claude icon in your status bar
   - Or use Command Palette: `Claude Code: Open Chat`

## üí° **Usage Examples**

### üî• **Code Review & Refactoring**
```
You: @src/components/UserProfile.tsx Can you review this component and suggest improvements?

Claude: I'll analyze your UserProfile component. Looking at the code, here are my recommendations:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Add React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **TypeScript Enhancement**: The props interface could be more specific
3. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels for screen readers

[Detailed analysis with code examples follows...]
```

### üìä **Project Analysis**
```
You: Analyze the overall architecture of my project and identify potential issues

Claude: I'll examine your project structure and identify areas for improvement:

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express
- MongoDB database layer

‚ö†Ô∏è **Identified Issues**
- Missing error boundaries in React components
- Database queries lack proper indexing
- API routes missing input validation

[Detailed recommendations with implementation examples...]
```

### üêõ **Debugging Assistant**
```
You: I'm getting a strange error in my API. Here's the stack trace: [paste error]

Claude: Looking at this stack trace, the issue appears to be a race condition in your async middleware. Here's what's happening:

1. **Root Cause**: Multiple requests are modifying shared state
2. **Solution**: Implement proper request isolation
3. **Prevention**: Add comprehensive error handling

[Step-by-step debugging guide follows...]
```

### ‚è™ **Safe Experimentation with Checkpoints**
```
You: Can you refactor this entire component to use hooks instead of class components?

Claude: I'll refactor your component to use React hooks. Don't worry - I'll create a checkpoint first so you can easily restore if needed.

[Creates automatic checkpoint]

Here's the refactored component using hooks:
[Shows the new implementation]

If you want to revert these changes, just click "Restore Checkpoint" to go back to your original code instantly.
```

### üé® **Agent Color Coding in Action** ‚≠ê **NEW IN V1.1.1**
```
You: /agents

Claude: [Background turns blue indicating development agent is active]
üîµ DevAgent: Here are all available agents:
- SecurityAgent (üî¥ Red) - Handles security, permissions, and safety
- DataAnalyst (üü¢ Green) - Processes data, creates charts and analysis
- DesignAgent (üü£ Purple) - UI/UX design and creative tasks
- TechnicalWriter (üü° Yellow) - Documentation and communication
... [40+ agents with color indicators]

You: Analyze the security vulnerabilities in my authentication system

Claude: [Background shifts to red indicating SecurityAgent is now active]
üî¥ SecurityAgent: I'll analyze your authentication system for security vulnerabilities...
```

### üîå **Three-Source MCP Integration** ‚≠ê **NEW IN V1.1.1**
```
You: [Opens MCP settings]

Extension automatically merges:
‚úÖ CLI Servers (from claude_config.json): playwright, postgres, filesystem
‚úÖ Extension Servers: permissions-mcp, custom-tools
‚úÖ Global Config (~/.claude/mcp.json): shared-database, api-tools

All 6 servers available in unified interface with Save/Cancel state management.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Open Claude Code Chat |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `@` | Open file picker |
| `/` | Open slash commands modal |

### WSL Configuration (Windows Users)
If you're using Claude Code through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you can configure the extension to use WSL:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Claude Code Chat"
3. Configure these settings:
   - **Claude Code Chat: WSL Enabled** - Enable WSL integration
   - **Claude Code Chat: WSL Distro** - Your WSL distribution name (e.g., `Ubuntu`, `Debian`)
   - **Claude Code Chat: WSL Node Path** - Path to Node.js in WSL (default: `/usr/bin/node`)
   - **Claude Code Chat: WSL Claude Path** - Path to Claude in WSL (default: `/usr/local/bin/claude`)

Example configuration in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "claudeCodeChat.wsl.enabled": true,
  "claudeCodeChat.wsl.distro": "Ubuntu",
  "claudeCodeChat.wsl.nodePath": "/usr/bin/node",
  "claudeCodeChat.wsl.claudePath": "/usr/local/bin/claude"
}
```

### NVM Integration (This Fork Only) ‚≠ê **NEW**
This fork includes NVM (Node Version Manager) integration to ensure terminal commands use your preferred Node.js environment:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Claude Code Chat"
3. Configure these settings:
   - **Claude Code Chat: NVM Enabled** - Enable NVM integration
   - **Claude Code Chat: NVM Version** - Specify your Node.js version (e.g., `22.9.0`)

Example configuration in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "claudeCodeChat.nvm.enabled": true,
  "claudeCodeChat.nvm.version": "22.9.0"
}
```

**How it works**: When you execute commands that open terminals (like `/terminal-setup`), the extension automatically:
1. Loads your NVM environment
2. Switches to the specified Node.js version
3. Then executes the Claude command

This ensures all terminal operations use your preferred Node.js environment instead of the system default.
