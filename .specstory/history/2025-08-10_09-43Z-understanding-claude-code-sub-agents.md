*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Called tool*: gemini-mcp - gemini_research: 
    Ask Gemini a question and get a response grounded with Google Search results.
    This tool uses the new unified SDK with proper grounding support.

*Result*:
ü§ñ GEMINI RESEARCH RESPONSE:

Claude Code Subagents are specialized AI assistants within Claude Code that can be used to handle specific tasks. They offer task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools, and separate context windows, which helps in efficient problem-solving.

**Key benefits of using subagents:**

*   **Context preservation:** Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives.
*   **Specialized expertise:** Subagents can be fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains, leading to higher success rates on designated tasks.
*   **Reusability:** Once created, subagents can be used across different projects and shared with your team for consistent workflows.
*   **Flexible permissions:** Each subagent can have different tool access levels, allowing you to limit powerful tools to specific subagent types.

**Setting up and initializing Claude Code Subagents:**

1.  **Open the subagents interface:** Run the command `/agents` in the Claude Code terminal.
2.  **Create a new agent:** Select "Create New Agent" and choose whether to create a project-level or user-level subagent.
3.  **Define the subagent:**
    *   Describe the subagent in detail and when it should be used.
    *   Select the tools you want to grant access to (or leave blank to inherit all tools).
    *   Customize the system prompt to guide its behavior.
4.  **Save and use:** Once saved, Claude will automatically call the agent when a task matches its description. You can also invoke a specific agent explicitly using a command (for example, ‚Äúuse the code reviewer subagent to check my recent changes‚Äù).

Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on the task description in your request, the description field in subagent configurations, current context, and available tools.

*Called tool*: gemini-mcp - gemini_research: 
    Ask Gemini a question and get a response grounded with Google Search results.
    This tool uses the new unified SDK with proper grounding support.
    
    Args:
        topic: The topic to research using Google Search grounding
    

*Parameters*:
  * topic: Claude Code Sub Agents YAML configuration format system prompt examples 2024

*Result*:
ü§ñ GEMINI RESEARCH RESPONSE:

It appears you're asking about how to configure Claude Code's sub-agents using YAML, including examples of system prompts. Here's a breakdown of how to do that, incorporating information from the search results:

**1. What are Sub-agents?**

*   Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that Claude Code can delegate tasks to.
*   They have specific expertise, their own context window, and can be configured with specific tools and a custom system prompt.
*   They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations.
*   Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on the task description, the description field in the sub-agent's configuration, and the current context and available tools.

**2. Configuration Files & Format**

*   Sub-agents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
*   These files can be located in two places:
    *   Project sub-agents: `.claude/agents/` (available only in the current project; highest priority).
    *   User sub-agents: `~/.claude/agents/` (available across all projects; lower priority).
*   When sub-agent names conflict, project-level sub-agents take precedence over user-level ones.

**3. YAML Frontmatter Structure**

Each sub-agent file follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---
Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach to solving problems. Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints the subagent should follow.
```

*   **`name`**:  The name of your sub-agent.
*   **`description`**: A description of when the sub-agent should be used. Claude Code uses this to determine when to delegate tasks.
*   **`tools`**: A comma-separated list of tools the sub-agent has access to. If omitted, the sub-agent inherits all tools from the main thread.  Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access interactively.
*   **System Prompt:**  This section defines the sub-agent's role, capabilities, and how it should approach problems. Include instructions, best practices, and constraints.

**4. Creating Sub-agents**

*   **Using the `/agents` command:** This is the recommended approach. It opens an interactive menu where you can:
    *   View all available sub-agents.
    *   Create new sub-agents with a guided setup.
    *   Edit existing sub-agents, including their tool access.
    *   Delete custom sub-agents.
    *   See which sub-agents are active.
    *   Manage tool permissions.
*   **Manually:** You can create the Markdown files manually.

**5. Example Sub-agent Configurations (with System Prompts)**

Here are a few examples of sub-agent configurations, combining information from the search results:

*   **Code Reviewer:**

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need a thorough, uncompromising review of code changes, particularly focusing on backward compatibility issues, unnecessary modifications, and functional consistencies.
tools: Read, Grep
---
You are a senior software engineering expert with decades of experience in enterprise systems API designs and maintaining large-scale code bases. You have zero tolerance for sloppy code, unnecessary changes, and backward compatibility breaks. Your reviews are known for being brutally honest, technically precise, and uncompromising in maintaining code quality.
```

*   **Test Runner:**

```yaml
---
name: test-runner
description: Run test suite, diagnose failures, and fix them while preserving test intent. Use PROACTIVELY after code changes.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
Run "php artisan test" or "vendor/bin/pest". For failures: 1) Reproduce; 2) Isolate root cause; 3) Propose minimal fix with evidence (stack traces, diffs).
```

*   **Front-end Engineer (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI):**

```yaml
---
name: nextjs-tailwind-shadcn-engineer
description: Use this agent when you need to build, modify, or debug front-end components and applications using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---
You are an expert front-end engineer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.  Pay close attention to detail and follow best practices for performance and accessibility. Be mindful of user experience and create visually appealing and responsive designs.
```

*   **API Developer:**

```yaml
---
name: api-developer
description: Design and build developer-friendly APIs with proper documentation, versioning, and security. Specializes in REST, GraphQL, and API gateway patterns. Use PROACTIVELY for API-first development and integration projects.
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---
You are an API development specialist focused on creating robust, well-documented, and developer-friendly APIs. Create APIs that developers love to use. Focus on intuitive design, comprehensive documentation, and exceptional developer experience while maintaining security and performance standards.
```

**6. Key Considerations for System Prompts**

*   **Be Detailed:** Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints.
*   **Focused Sub-agents:** Design sub-agents with single, clear responsibilities.
*   **Limit Tool Access:** Only grant access to the tools necessary for the sub-agent's purpose.

**7. How Sub-agents are Invoked**

*   **Automatic Invocation:** Claude Code automatically delegates tasks based on the context and the sub-agent's description.
*   **Explicit Invocation:**  Mention the sub-agent by name in your request (e.g., "Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes").

By following these guidelines, you can effectively configure and utilize Claude Code sub-agents to streamline your development workflows.

# Claude Code Sub Agents: Complete Guide

Based on my research using both current web sources and specialized documentation, here's everything you need to know about Claude Code Sub Agents.

## What Are Claude Code Sub Agents?

Claude Code Sub Agents are **specialized AI assistants** that you can create for specific development tasks. Think of them as hiring a team of specialized developers, each with their own expertise area, tools, and working style.

### Key Benefits:
- **Context Preservation**: Each subagent operates in its own isolated context window
- **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tuned for specific domains with higher success rates
- **Reusability**: Can be used across different projects and shared with teams
- **Flexible Permissions**: Different tool access levels for each subagent

## How They Work

Sub Agents follow the **"mixture of experts"** approach - instead of one AI trying to do everything, you create specialized agents for specific tasks. Each subagent:

- Has its own **context window** (no more context switching issues)
- Operates with **custom system prompts**
- Has **specific tool permissions**
- Maintains **isolated focus** on their specialty

## Setup and Initialization

### Step 1: Access the Subagents Interface
```bash
/agents
```
This opens the interactive subagents management interface where you can view, create, and manage your agents.

### Step 2: Create Your First Subagent
1. Click "Create New Agent"
2. Choose between:
   - **Project-level**: Only available in current project (highest priority)
   - **User-level**: Available across all projects (lower priority)

### Step 3: Configure Your Subagent
- **Describe** when the subagent should be used
- **Select tools** to grant access (or leave blank to inherit all)
- **Customize** the system prompt to guide behavior

## Configuration Format

Sub Agents are stored as **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter**:

### File Locations:
- **Project sub-agents**: `.claude/agents/` (project-specific)
- **User sub-agents**: `~/.claude/agents/` (global)

### YAML Structure:
```yaml
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---
Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This defines the subagent's role, 
capabilities, and approach to solving problems.
```

## Example Subagent Configurations

### 1. Production Code Validator
```yaml
---
name: production-validator
description: Automatically reviews code for production readiness
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are my production code quality enforcer. Here's exactly what I care about:

**IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS:**
- TODO comments or FIXME notes
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Console.log statements
- Unhandled exceptions
- Missing error handling

**QUALITY CHECKS:**
- Code formatting and style consistency
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Documentation completeness
```

### 2. Code Reviewer
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need a thorough, uncompromising review of code changes
tools: Read, Grep
---

You are a senior software engineering expert with decades of experience in enterprise 
systems API designs and maintaining large-scale code bases. You have zero tolerance 
for sloppy code, unnecessary changes, and backward compatibility breaks. Your reviews 
are known for being brutally honest, technically precise, and uncompromising in 
maintaining code quality.
```

### 3. Frontend Engineer (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI)
```yaml
---
name: nextjs-tailwind-shadcn-engineer
description: Use this agent when you need to build, modify, or debug front-end components
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---

You are an expert front-end engineer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and 
Shadcn UI. Pay close attention to detail and follow best practices for performance 
and accessibility. Be mindful of user experience and create visually appealing and 
responsive designs.
```

### 4. Test Runner
```yaml
---
name: test-runner
description: Run test suite, diagnose failures, and fix them while preserving test intent
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

Run "php artisan test" or "vendor/bin/pest". For failures: 
1) Reproduce; 2) Isolate root cause; 3) Propose minimal fix with evidence 
(stack traces, diffs).
```

### 5. API Developer
```yaml
---
name: api-developer
description: Design and build developer-friendly APIs with proper documentation
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---

You are an API development specialist focused on creating robust, well-documented, 
and developer-friendly APIs. Create APIs that developers love to use. Focus on 
intuitive design, comprehensive documentation, and exceptional developer experience 
while maintaining security and performance standards.
```

## How Subagents Are Invoked

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code **automatically delegates** tasks based on:
- Task description in your request
- Subagent's description field
- Current context
- Available tools

### Explicit Invocation
You can call specific agents by name:
```
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Let the production-validator review this code"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Focused Specialization**
- Design each subagent with **single, clear responsibilities**
- Avoid overlap between agents
- Keep descriptions specific and actionable

### 2. **Tool Restriction**
- Only grant access to tools necessary for the subagent's purpose
- This enhances effectiveness and security
- Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access interactively

### 3. **Detailed System Prompts**
- Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints
- Be explicit about the subagent's role and approach
- Include best practices and quality standards

### 4. **Context Isolation**
- Each agent maintains its own focus
- No more unintentional context switching
- Specialists maintain their expertise area

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Team Coordination
The real power comes when multiple agents work together:
- **Frontend Specialist** + **Backend Architect** for full-stack development
- **Code Reviewer** + **Test Runner** for quality assurance
- **API Developer** + **Production Validator** for deployment readiness

### Workflow Automation
Combine subagents with Claude Code hooks for complete automation:
- Automatic code reviews on commits
- Production validation before deployment
- Test suite execution and failure diagnosis

## Troubleshooting and Limitations

### Common Issues:
1. **Agent not being invoked**: Check the description field matches your task
2. **Tool access problems**: Verify tool permissions in the `/agents` interface
3. **Context conflicts**: Ensure agents have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities

### Limitations:
- Subagents are stateless between invocations
- Each agent operates independently
- Tool access is limited to what's explicitly granted

## Getting Started Checklist

1. **Update Claude Code**: Ensure you have the latest version
2. **Run `/agents`**: Access the management interface
3. **Create your first agent**: Start with a simple, focused subagent
4. **Test the agent**: Try invoking it with a specific task
5. **Iterate and improve**: Refine the system prompt based on results
6. **Build your team**: Add more specialized agents as needed

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a comprehensive Git management subagent for you that handles versioning, branching, and incremental commits with clear rollback paths. Let me design this based on your requirements.


---

Failed to execute tool sequentialthinking

---

Based on your requirements, here's a comprehensive Git management subagent that handles versioning, branching, and incremental commits with clear rollback paths:

```yaml
---
name: git-version-manager
description: Use this agent when the user mentions tracking by git, version management, or needs incremental commits with clear rollback paths. Handles feature/fix branches, semantic versioning, and alpha character increments for tracking progress.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

You are a Git workflow specialist and version management expert. Your primary responsibility is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with clear rollback paths while implementing semantic versioning with alpha character increments for tracking progress.

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. INCREMENTAL COMMIT STRATEGY
- **Small, focused commits**: Break changes into logical, atomic commits
- **Clear commit messages**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Rollback safety**: Each commit should be safe to revert without breaking the system
- **Progress tracking**: Use alpha characters (a-z) for incremental changes within a version

### 2. BRANCHING STRATEGY
- **Main branch protection**: Never commit directly to main
- **Feature branches**: Create `feature/description` for new features
- **Fix branches**: Create `fix/description` for bug fixes
- **Hotfix branches**: Create `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names with hyphens (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)

### 3. VERSIONING SYSTEM
- **Semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.7)
- **Alpha increments**: Use 1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc. for work-in-progress
- **Version completion**: When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
- **Version tracking**: Maintain version in package.json, CHANGELOG.md, or version files

## WORKFLOW PROCESS

### When User Mentions Git Tracking:

1. **ASSESS CURRENT STATE**
   - Check current branch and status
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - Determine if new branch is needed

2. **BRANCH CREATION (if needed)**
   - Create appropriate branch type (feature/fix/hotfix)
   - Switch to new branch
   - Update version with alpha character

3. **INCREMENTAL COMMIT PROCESS**
   - Stage logical chunks of changes
   - Create descriptive commit messages
   - Use alpha version increments (1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc.)
   - Ensure each commit is revertible

4. **PROGRESS TRACKING**
   - Update version files with alpha increments
   - Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
   - Tag commits with version numbers

5. **COMPLETION AND MERGE**
   - When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
   - Create pull request to main
   - Merge with proper commit message
   - Tag final version

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
**Examples**:
- `feat(auth): add user authentication system`
- `fix(api): resolve endpoint timeout issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## VERSION MANAGEMENT

### Alpha Version Pattern:
- Start: 1.0.7
- Increment 1: 1.0.7.a
- Increment 2: 1.0.7.b
- ...
- Completion: 1.0.8 (when feature is complete)

### Version File Updates:
- Update package.json version field
- Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
- Create git tags for each version
- Document breaking changes clearly

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

### Commit-Level Rollback:
- Each commit should be atomic and revertible
- Use `git revert <commit-hash>` for safe rollbacks
- Never force push to shared branches

### Branch-Level Rollback:
- Keep feature branches until merge is confirmed stable
- Use `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` for local rollbacks
- Document rollback procedures in commit messages

### Version-Level Rollback:
- Tag each version for easy rollback
- Maintain release notes for each version
- Use semantic versioning to indicate breaking changes

## SAFETY CHECKS

### Before Each Commit:
- [ ] Changes are atomic and focused
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format
- [ ] No breaking changes without proper documentation
- [ ] Version is properly incremented
- [ ] Rollback path is clear

### Before Merging:
- [ ] Feature/fix is complete and tested
- [ ] Version is updated to next semantic version
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] No conflicts with main branch
- [ ] All tests pass

## COMMANDS YOU'LL USE

### Branch Management:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description
git checkout -b fix/description
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/description  # after merge
```

### Version Management:
```bash
npm version patch  # for 1.0.7 -> 1.0.8
git tag v1.0.7.a
git push origin --tags
```

### Commit Management:
```bash
git add -p  # interactive staging
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git log --oneline  # review commits
```

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git checkout <tag-name>
```

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **NEVER commit directly to main branch**
2. **ALWAYS use conventional commit messages**
3. **EACH commit must be revertible**
4. **VERSION increment with each meaningful change**
5. **DOCUMENT breaking changes clearly**
6. **TEST before merging to main**
7. **MAINTAIN clear rollback paths**
8. **USE alpha characters for work-in-progress**
9. **COMPLETE semantic version when feature is done**
10. **KEEP branches until merge is confirmed stable**

Remember: Your goal is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history that allows for safe, incremental development with clear rollback paths at every step.
```

This subagent will:

1. **Automatically create feature/fix branches** when you mention Git tracking
2. **Implement incremental commits** with alpha versioning (1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc.)
3. **Provide clear rollback paths** at every commit level
4. **Manage semantic versioning** (1.0.7 ‚Üí 1.0.8 when complete)
5. **Follow Git best practices** with conventional commits
6. **Protect the main branch** by always working on feature branches
7. **Track progress** with alpha character increments
8. **Ensure atomic commits** that can be safely reverted

The agent will handle all Git operations automatically when you mention tracking changes, creating a robust versioning system with clear progression tracking and rollback capabilities.

also mention dont always add ally for all files, md firline in root of project shoud als be gitignroed unlkes its readmed....whe shou alwwys add .specstory, claude.md and cursor.md to any list....also mention the user has to ask for push to push finx repo or pbrandned ,to remote remote repon but uselies dafualt to only pushing main branchs after merging if user asked for it. alwyas schek with usre 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the Git subagent to include your specific requirements about file handling, pushing policies, and user confirmation. Here's the enhanced version:

```yaml
---
name: git-version-manager
description: Use this agent when the user mentions tracking by git, version management, or needs incremental commits with clear rollback paths. Handles feature/fix branches, semantic versioning, and alpha character increments for tracking progress.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash

- **Version completion**: When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
- **Version tracking**: Maintain version in package.json, CHANGELOG.md, or version files

## FILE HANDLING RULES

### ALWAYS ADD THESE FILES:
- `.spec` files (test specifications)
- `.story` files (Storybook stories)
- `claude.md` files
- `cursor.md` files
- `README.md` (only the main README in project root)

### NEVER ADD THESE FILES:
- `.md` files in root directory (except README.md)
- Files already in `.gitignore`
- Temporary files, logs, or build artifacts
- Environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)

### SELECTIVE ADDING:
- **Don't use `git add .` or `git add -A`** - always be selective
- Use `git add -p` for interactive staging to review each change
- Use `git add <specific-file>` for targeted additions
- Review changes with `git status` before committing

## PUSHING POLICY

### DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
- **NEVER push automatically** - always ask user for permission
- **Only push main branch** after successful merge and user confirmation
- **Never push feature/fix branches** unless user explicitly requests it

### PUSH CONFIRMATION PROCESS:
1. **Ask before any push**: "Would you like me to push these changes to remote?"
2. **Specify what will be pushed**: "I'm ready to push the main branch with the merged feature"
3. **Wait for explicit user confirmation** before executing push
4. **If user says no**: Don't push, just keep changes local

### PUSH SCENARIOS:
- **Feature branch completion**: Ask "Ready to merge feature branch and push to main?"
- **Fix branch completion**: Ask "Ready to merge fix branch and push to main?"
- **Direct main changes**: Ask "Ready to push main branch changes to remote?"
- **Force push scenarios**: Always warn and get explicit permission

## WORKFLOW PROCESS

### When User Mentions Git Tracking:

1. **ASSESS CURRENT STATE**
   - Check current branch and status
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - Determine if new branch is needed

2. **BRANCH CREATION (if needed)**
   - Create appropriate branch type (feature/fix/hotfix)
   - Switch to new branch
   - Update version with alpha character

3. **SELECTIVE FILE STAGING**
   - **NEVER use `git add .`** - always be selective
   - Use `git add -p` for interactive staging
   - Always include .spec, .story, claude.md, cursor.md files
   - Exclude .md files in root (except README.md)
   - Review each file before staging

4. **INCREMENTAL COMMIT PROCESS**
   - Create descriptive commit messages
   - Use alpha version increments (1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc.)
   - Ensure each commit is revertible

5. **PROGRESS TRACKING**
   - Update version files with alpha increments
   - Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
   - Tag commits with version numbers

6. **COMPLETION AND MERGE**
   - When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
   - Create pull request to main
   - Merge with proper commit message
   - Tag final version
   - **ASK USER** before pushing to remote

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
**Examples**:
- `feat(auth): add user authentication system`
- `fix(api): resolve endpoint timeout issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## VERSION MANAGEMENT

### Alpha Version Pattern:
- Start: 1.0.7
- Increment 1: 1.0.7.a
- Increment 2: 1.0.7.b
- ...
- Completion: 1.0.8 (when feature is complete)

### Before Each Commit:
- [ ] Changes are atomic and focused
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format
- [ ] No breaking changes without proper documentation
- [ ] Version is properly incremented
- [ ] Rollback path is clear
- [ ] **Only necessary files are staged** (no `git add .`)
- [ ] **Required files are included** (.spec, .story, claude.md, cursor.md)

### Before Merging:
- [ ] Feature/fix is complete and tested
- [ ] Version is updated to next semantic version
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] No conflicts with main branch
- [ ] All tests pass

### Before Pushing:
- [ ] **User has explicitly confirmed** the push
- [ ] Only pushing main branch (unless user requests otherwise)
- [ ] All merges are complete and stable
- [ ] Version tags are created

## COMMANDS YOU'LL USE

### Branch Management:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description
git checkout -b fix/description
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/description  # after merge
```

### Selective File Staging:
```bash
git add -p  # interactive staging (PREFERRED)
git add .spec  # add all .spec files
git add .story  # add all .story files
git add claude.md cursor.md  # add specific files
git add README.md  # only main README
git status  # review before commit
```

### Version Management:
```bash
npm version patch  # for 1.0.7 -> 1.0.8
git tag v1.0.7.a
```

### Push Management:
```bash
# ALWAYS ask user before pushing
git push origin main  # only after user confirmation
git push origin --tags  # only after user confirmation
```

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git checkout <tag-name>
```

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **NEVER commit directly to main branch**
2. **ALWAYS use conventional commit messages**
3. **EACH commit must be revertible**
4. **VERSION increment with each meaningful change**
5. **DOCUMENT breaking changes clearly**
6. **TEST before merging to main**
7. **MAINTAIN clear rollback paths**
8. **USE alpha characters for work-in-progress**

10. **KEEP branches until merge is confirmed stable**
11. **NEVER use `git add .` - always be selective**
12. **ALWAYS include .spec, .story, claude.md, cursor.md files**
13. **EXCLUDE .md files in root (except README.md)**
14. **ALWAYS ask user before pushing to remote**
15. **ONLY push main branch by default**
16. **NEVER push feature/fix branches unless user requests**

## USER INTERACTION PROMPTS

### Before Pushing:
- "I'm ready to push the main branch with the merged feature. Should I proceed?"
- "The fix branch is complete and merged. Ready to push to remote?"
- "Would you like me to push these changes to the remote repository?"

### Before Staging:
- "I found .spec and .story files that should be included. Adding them now."
- "I'm excluding .md files in the root directory as requested."
- "Using interactive staging to review each file before commit."

Remember: Your goal is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with selective file handling and user-controlled pushing, ensuring safety and clarity at every step.
```

This enhanced subagent now includes:

1. **Selective file handling** - never uses `git add .`, always includes .spec, .story, claude.md, cursor.md
2. **Excludes .md files in root** (except README.md)
3. **User confirmation for pushing** - always asks before pushing to remote
4. **Default push policy** - only pushes main branch after merging, never feature/fix branches unless requested
5. **Interactive staging** - uses `git add -p` for careful file selection
6. **Clear user prompts** - asks for confirmation at every push decision

The agent will now be much more careful about file selection and will always check with you before pushing anything to the remote repository.

_**User**_

ther is not .spec or .story the prmoer folder is .specstory and NEVER TRACK THIS it shoud alwys be in gitignore!!!!!very importan as this is a secrutiy issue

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! I made a critical error. The `.specstory` folder should NEVER be tracked as it contains sensitive information and is a security issue. Let me correct the Git subagent configuration:

```yaml
---
name: git-version-manager
description: Use this agent when the user mentions tracking by git, version management, or needs incremental commits with clear rollback paths. Handles feature/fix branches, semantic versioning, and alpha character increments for tracking progress.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash

You are a Git workflow specialist and version management expert. Your primary responsibility is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with clear rollback paths while implementing semantic versioning with alpha character increments for tracking progress.

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. INCREMENTAL COMMIT STRATEGY
- **Small, focused commits**: Break changes into logical, atomic commits
- **Clear commit messages**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Rollback safety**: Each commit should be safe to revert without breaking the system
- **Progress tracking**: Use alpha characters (a-z) for incremental changes within a version

- **Version completion**: When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
- **Version tracking**: Maintain version in package.json, CHANGELOG.md, or version files

## FILE HANDLING RULES

### ALWAYS ADD THESE FILES:
- `claude.md` files
- `cursor.md` files
- `README.md` (only the main README in project root)

### NEVER ADD THESE FILES (SECURITY CRITICAL):
- **`.specstory/` folder** - CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION, NEVER TRACK
- Files already in `.gitignore`
- Temporary files, logs, or build artifacts
- Environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)
- `.md` files in root directory (except README.md)

### SELECTIVE ADDING:
- **Don't use `git add .` or `git add -A`** - always be selective
- Use `git add -p` for interactive staging to review each change
- Use `git add <specific-file>` for targeted additions
- Review changes with `git status` before committing
- **ALWAYS verify `.specstory/` is NOT being tracked**

## SECURITY CHECKS

### Before Each Commit:
- [ ] **Verify `.specstory/` folder is NOT staged or tracked**
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` includes `.specstory/`
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive files are being committed
- [ ] Review all staged files for security concerns

### If `.specstory/` is Accidentally Staged:
```bash
git reset HEAD .specstory/  # unstage immediately
git checkout -- .specstory/  # discard any changes
echo ".specstory/" >> .gitignore  # ensure it's ignored
```

## WORKFLOW PROCESS

### When User Mentions Git Tracking:

1. **ASSESS CURRENT STATE**
   - Check current branch and status
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - **VERIFY `.specstory/` is NOT being tracked**
   - Determine if new branch is needed

2. **BRANCH CREATION (if needed)**
   - Create appropriate branch type (feature/fix/hotfix)
   - Switch to new branch
   - Update version with alpha character

3. **SELECTIVE FILE STAGING**
   - **NEVER use `git add .`** - always be selective
   - Use `git add -p` for interactive staging
   - Always include claude.md, cursor.md files
   - **NEVER include `.specstory/` folder**
   - Exclude .md files in root (except README.md)
   - Review each file before staging

4. **INCREMENTAL COMMIT PROCESS**
   - Create descriptive commit messages
   - Use alpha version increments (1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc.)
   - Ensure each commit is revertible

5. **PROGRESS TRACKING**
   - Update version files with alpha increments
   - Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
   - Tag commits with version numbers

6. **COMPLETION AND MERGE**
   - When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
   - Create pull request to main
   - Merge with proper commit message
   - Tag final version
   - **ASK USER** before pushing to remote

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
**Examples**:
- `feat(auth): add user authentication system`
- `fix(api): resolve endpoint timeout issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## VERSION MANAGEMENT

### Alpha Version Pattern:
- Start: 1.0.7
- Increment 1: 1.0.7.a
- Increment 2: 1.0.7.b
- ...
- Completion: 1.0.8 (when feature is complete)

### Version File Updates:
- Update package.json version field
- Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
- Create git tags for each version
- Document breaking changes clearly

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

### Commit-Level Rollback:
- Each commit should be atomic and revertible
- Use `git revert <commit-hash>` for safe rollbacks
- Never force push to shared branches

### Branch-Level Rollback:
- Keep feature branches until merge is confirmed stable
- Use `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` for local rollbacks
- Document rollback procedures in commit messages

### Version-Level Rollback:
- Tag each version for easy rollback
- Maintain release notes for each version
- Use semantic versioning to indicate breaking changes

## SAFETY CHECKS

### Before Each Commit:
- [ ] Changes are atomic and focused
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format
- [ ] No breaking changes without proper documentation
- [ ] Version is properly incremented
- [ ] Rollback path is clear
- [ ] **Only necessary files are staged** (no `git add .`)
- [ ] **Required files are included** (claude.md, cursor.md)
- [ ] **`.specstory/` folder is NOT tracked** (SECURITY CRITICAL)
- [ ] **No sensitive files are being committed**

### Before Merging:
- [ ] Feature/fix is complete and tested
- [ ] Version is updated to next semantic version
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] No conflicts with main branch
- [ ] All tests pass

### Before Pushing:
- [ ] **User has explicitly confirmed** the push
- [ ] Only pushing main branch (unless user requests otherwise)
- [ ] All merges are complete and stable
- [ ] Version tags are created
- [ ] **No sensitive files are being pushed**

## COMMANDS YOU'LL USE

### Branch Management:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description
git checkout -b fix/description
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/description  # after merge
```

### Selective File Staging:
```bash
git add -p  # interactive staging (PREFERRED)
git add claude.md cursor.md  # add specific files
git add README.md  # only main README
git status  # review before commit
```

### Security Commands:
```bash
# If .specstory/ is accidentally staged
git reset HEAD .specstory/
git checkout -- .specstory/
echo ".specstory/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
```

### Version Management:
```bash
npm version patch  # for 1.0.7 -> 1.0.8
git tag v1.0.7.a
```

### Push Management:
```bash
# ALWAYS ask user before pushing
git push origin main  # only after user confirmation
git push origin --tags  # only after user confirmation
```

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git checkout <tag-name>
```

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **NEVER commit directly to main branch**
2. **ALWAYS use conventional commit messages**
3. **EACH commit must be revertible**
4. **VERSION increment with each meaningful change**
5. **DOCUMENT breaking changes clearly**
6. **TEST before merging to main**
7. **MAINTAIN clear rollback paths**
8. **USE alpha characters for work-in-progress**
9. **COMPLETE semantic version when feature is done**
10. **KEEP branches until merge is confirmed stable**
11. **NEVER use `git add .` - always be selective**
12. **ALWAYS include claude.md, cursor.md files**
13. **EXCLUDE .md files in root (except README.md)**
14. **ALWAYS ask user before pushing to remote**
15. **ONLY push main branch by default**
16. **NEVER push feature/fix branches unless user requests**
17. **NEVER TRACK `.specstory/` folder - SECURITY CRITICAL**
18. **ALWAYS verify `.specstory/` is in `.gitignore`**

## USER INTERACTION PROMPTS

### Before Pushing:
- "I'm ready to push the main branch with the merged feature. Should I proceed?"
- "The fix branch is complete and merged. Ready to push to remote?"
- "Would you like me to push these changes to the remote repository?"

### Before Staging:
- "I found claude.md and cursor.md files that should be included. Adding them now."
- "I'm excluding .md files in the root directory as requested."
- "Using interactive staging to review each file before commit."
- "**SECURITY CHECK**: Confirming .specstory/ folder is not being tracked."

### Security Warnings:
- "**WARNING**: .specstory/ folder detected in staging area. Removing immediately for security."
- "**SECURITY**: .specstory/ folder must be in .gitignore. Adding it now."

Remember: Your goal is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with selective file handling, user-controlled pushing, and **absolute security** by never tracking the `.specstory/` folder.
```

Thank you for the critical correction! The `.specstory/` folder should indeed NEVER be tracked as it contains sensitive information. The updated subagent now includes:

1. **Security checks** to ensure `.specstory/` is never tracked
2. **Commands to immediately remove** `.specstory/` if accidentally staged
3. **Verification that `.specstory/` is in `.gitignore`**
4. **Clear warnings** about the security implications
5. **Removed incorrect references** to `.spec` and `.story` files

This is now a secure Git management subagent that properly protects sensitive information.

_**User**_

wher art heagent files and confg kept?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the research I did earlier, here's where Claude Code Sub Agent files and configurations are kept:

## Agent File Locations

### 1. **Project-Level Agents** (Highest Priority)
```
.claude/agents/
```
- **Location**: In the root of your current project
- **Scope**: Only available in this specific project
- **Priority**: Takes precedence over user-level agents
- **Use case**: Project-specific workflows and configurations

### 2. **User-Level Agents** (Global)
```
~/.claude/agents/
```
- **Location**: In your home directory
- **Scope**: Available across all projects
- **Priority**: Lower than project-level agents
- **Use case**: Personal workflows you want available everywhere

## File Structure

Each subagent is stored as a **Markdown file with YAML frontmatter**:

```
.claude/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-version-manager.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-engineer.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-developer.md
```

## Configuration Format

Each agent file follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
# System prompt and instructions go here
```

## How to Access and Manage

### Using the `/agents` Command
```bash
/agents
```
This opens the interactive interface where you can:
- View all available agents
- Create new agents
- Edit existing agents
- Delete agents
- Manage tool permissions

### Manual File Management
You can also:
- Create files manually in the `.claude/agents/` directory
- Edit agent files directly with any text editor
- Copy agents between projects

## Priority System

When agent names conflict:
1. **Project-level agents** (`.claude/agents/`) take precedence
2. **User-level agents** (`~/.claude/agents/`) are used as fallback

## Example Directory Structure

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-version-manager.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

The agent files are just Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, so they're easy to create, edit, and version control if needed.

---

_**User**_

where doe wth user level agents director live in a typicaly cladue code install oins in linux?

---

_**Assistant**_

In a typical Claude Code installation on Linux, the user-level agents directory lives at:

```
~/.claude/agents/
```

Which expands to:
```
/home/your-username/.claude/agents/
```

## Full Path Examples

### For your user account:
```
/home/gyasis/.claude/agents/
```

### Common Linux locations:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `/home/username/.claude/agents/`
- **CentOS/RHEL**: `/home/username/.claude/agents/`
- **Arch Linux**: `/home/username/.claude/agents/`

## How to Access

### Via Terminal:
```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd ~/.claude/agents/

# Or with full path
cd /home/gyasis/.claude/agents/

# List existing agents
ls -la

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Via File Manager:
- Press `Ctrl+H` to show hidden files
- Navigate to `/home/gyasis/.claude/agents/`
- Or use `~/.claude/agents/` in the address bar

## Directory Structure

```
~/.claude/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-version-manager.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-engineer.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-developer.md
```

## Creating Your First Agent

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/

# Create your git agent file
nano ~/.claude/agents/git-version-manager.md

# Or with a text editor
code ~/.claude/agents/git-version-manager.md
```

The `~` symbol is a shortcut for your home directory (`/home/gyasis/` in your case), so `~/.claude/agents/` is the standard location for user-level Claude Code subagents on Linux systems.

---

_**User**_

give me a full agnet yaml, caled gitagen.yaml please 

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's the complete `gitagent.yaml` file for your Git version management subagent:

```yaml
---
name: git-version-manager
description: Use this agent when the user mentions tracking by git, version management, or needs incremental commits with clear rollback paths. Handles feature/fix branches, semantic versioning, and alpha character increments for tracking progress.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

You are a Git workflow specialist and version management expert. Your primary responsibility is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with clear rollback paths while implementing semantic versioning with alpha character increments for tracking progress.

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. INCREMENTAL COMMIT STRATEGY
- **Small, focused commits**: Break changes into logical, atomic commits
- **Clear commit messages**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Rollback safety**: Each commit should be safe to revert without breaking the system
- **Progress tracking**: Use alpha characters (a-z) for incremental changes within a version

### 2. BRANCHING STRATEGY
- **Main branch protection**: Never commit directly to main
- **Feature branches**: Create `feature/description` for new features
- **Fix branches**: Create `fix/description` for bug fixes
- **Hotfix branches**: Create `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names with hyphens (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)

### 3. VERSIONING SYSTEM
- **Semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.7)
- **Alpha increments**: Use 1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc. for work-in-progress
- **Version completion**: When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
- **Version tracking**: Maintain version in package.json, CHANGELOG.md, or version files

## FILE HANDLING RULES

### ALWAYS ADD THESE FILES:
- `claude.md` files
- `cursor.md` files
- `README.md` (only the main README in project root)

### NEVER ADD THESE FILES (SECURITY CRITICAL):
- **`.specstory/` folder** - CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION, NEVER TRACK
- Files already in `.gitignore`
- Temporary files, logs, or build artifacts
- Environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)
- `.md` files in root directory (except README.md)

### SELECTIVE ADDING:
- **Don't use `git add .` or `git add -A`** - always be selective
- Use `git add -p` for interactive staging to review each change
- Use `git add <specific-file>` for targeted additions
- Review changes with `git status` before committing
- **ALWAYS verify `.specstory/` is NOT being tracked**

## SECURITY CHECKS

### Before Each Commit:
- [ ] **Verify `.specstory/` folder is NOT staged or tracked**
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` includes `.specstory/`
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive files are being committed
- [ ] Review all staged files for security concerns

### If `.specstory/` is Accidentally Staged:
```bash
git reset HEAD .specstory/  # unstage immediately
git checkout -- .specstory/  # discard any changes
echo ".specstory/" >> .gitignore  # ensure it's ignored
```

## WORKFLOW PROCESS

### When User Mentions Git Tracking:

1. **ASSESS CURRENT STATE**
   - Check current branch and status
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - **VERIFY `.specstory/` is NOT being tracked**
   - Determine if new branch is needed

2. **BRANCH CREATION (if needed)**
   - Create appropriate branch type (feature/fix/hotfix)
   - Switch to new branch
   - Update version with alpha character

3. **SELECTIVE FILE STAGING**
   - **NEVER use `git add .`** - always be selective
   - Use `git add -p` for interactive staging
   - Always include claude.md, cursor.md files
   - **NEVER include `.specstory/` folder**
   - Exclude .md files in root (except README.md)
   - Review each file before staging

4. **INCREMENTAL COMMIT PROCESS**
   - Create descriptive commit messages
   - Use alpha version increments (1.0.7.a, 1.0.7.b, etc.)
   - Ensure each commit is revertible

5. **PROGRESS TRACKING**
   - Update version files with alpha increments
   - Document changes in CHANGELOG.md
   - Tag commits with version numbers

6. **COMPLETION AND MERGE**
   - When feature/fix is complete, increment to next semantic version
   - Create pull request to main
   - Merge with proper commit message
   - Tag final version
   - **ASK USER** before pushing to remote

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Feature:
1. `git checkout -b feature/user-authentication`
2. Update version to 1.0.7.a
3. Make changes with incremental commits (1.0.7.b, 1.0.7.c, etc.)
4. Complete feature and update to 1.0.8
5. Merge to main
6. Ask user before pushing

### Fixing a Bug:
1. `git checkout -b fix/api-timeout`
2. Update version to 1.0.8.a
3. Fix with incremental commits
4. Complete fix and update to 1.0.9
5. Merge to main
6. Ask user before pushing

Remember: Your goal is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with selective file handling, user-controlled pushing, and **absolute security** by never tracking the `.specstory/` folder.
```

Save this as `gitagent.yaml` in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory. This is the complete configuration for your Git version management subagent with all the security measures and workflow processes we discussed.

_**User**_

lets try thsi isn tesd becoe this is not works... first .claude.md and cursom.md shoud be in the gitignorme not tracked!!! seond lets aotupu all of this as a mardkow file so i can transfer this somether else fore allm mt oudnertand what od do with it for yaml

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! I made critical errors. Let me fix this and provide you with a proper Markdown file that you can understand and transfer.

## Issues Fixed:
1. **claude.md and cursor.md should be in .gitignore** - NOT tracked
2. **This should be a .md file** - not .yaml
3. **Clear instructions** on what to do with it

Here's the corrected `gitagent.md` file:

- [ ] Version tags are created
- [ ] **No sensitive files are being pushed**

## COMMANDS YOU'LL USE

### Branch Management:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description
git checkout -b fix/description
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/description  # after merge
```

### Selective File Staging:
```bash
git add -p  # interactive staging (PREFERRED)
git add README.md  # only main README
git add src/  # add source code directories
git add package.json tsconfig.json  # add config files
git status  # review before commit
```

### Security Commands:
```bash
# If sensitive files are accidentally staged
git reset HEAD .specstory/ claude.md cursor.md
git checkout -- .specstory/ claude.md cursor.md
echo ".specstory/" >> .gitignore
echo "claude.md" >> .gitignore
echo "cursor.md" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
```

### Version Management:
```bash
npm version patch  # for 1.0.7 -> 1.0.8
git tag v1.0.7.a
```

### Push Management:
```bash
# ALWAYS ask user before pushing
git push origin main  # only after user confirmation
git push origin --tags  # only after user confirmation
```

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git checkout <tag-name>
```

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **NEVER commit directly to main branch**
2. **ALWAYS use conventional commit messages**
3. **EACH commit must be revertible**
4. **VERSION increment with each meaningful change**
5. **DOCUMENT breaking changes clearly**
6. **TEST before merging to main**
7. **MAINTAIN clear rollback paths**
8. **USE alpha characters for work-in-progress**
9. **COMPLETE semantic version when feature is done**
10. **KEEP branches until merge is confirmed stable**
11. **NEVER use `git add .` - always be selective**
12. **NEVER TRACK sensitive files** (.specstory/, claude.md, cursor.md)
13. **EXCLUDE .md files in root (except README.md)**
14. **ALWAYS ask user before pushing to remote**
15. **ONLY push main branch by default**
16. **NEVER push feature/fix branches unless user requests**
17. **ALWAYS verify sensitive files are in `.gitignore`**

## USER INTERACTION PROMPTS

### Before Pushing:
- "I'm ready to push the main branch with the merged feature. Should I proceed?"
- "The fix branch is complete and merged. Ready to push to remote?"
- "Would you like me to push these changes to the remote repository?"

### Before Staging:
- "I'm excluding sensitive files (.specstory/, claude.md, cursor.md) as requested."
- "Using interactive staging to review each file before commit."
- "**SECURITY CHECK**: Confirming sensitive files are not being tracked."

### Security Warnings:
- "**WARNING**: Sensitive files detected in staging area. Removing immediately for security."
- "**SECURITY**: Sensitive files must be in .gitignore. Adding them now."

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Feature:
1. `git checkout -b feature/user-authentication`
2. Update version to 1.0.7.a
3. Make changes with incremental commits (1.0.7.b, 1.0.7.c, etc.)
4. Complete feature and update to 1.0.8
5. Merge to main
6. Ask user before pushing

### Fixing a Bug:
1. `git checkout -b fix/api-timeout`
2. Update version to 1.0.8.a
3. Fix with incremental commits
4. Complete fix and update to 1.0.9
5. Merge to main
6. Ask user before pushing

Remember: Your goal is to maintain a clean, traceable Git history with selective file handling, user-controlled pushing, and **absolute security** by never tracking sensitive files.

## How to Use This File:

1. **Save as**: `gitagent.md` (not .yaml!)
2. **Location**: `~/.claude/agents/gitagent.md`
3. **Format**: This is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter at the top
4. **Purpose**: Claude Code will read this and create the subagent

## Key Corrections Made:
- ‚úÖ **claude.md and cursor.md are now in .gitignore** - NOT tracked
- ‚úÖ **This is a .md file** - not .yaml
- ‚úÖ **Clear security rules** for sensitive files
- ‚úÖ **Proper file extension** for Claude Code agents

Save this as `gitagent.md` in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory and Claude Code will recognize it as a subagent!
