*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Called tool*: gemini-mcp - gemini_research: 
    Ask Gemini a question and get a response grounded with Google Search results.
    This tool uses the new unified SDK with proper grounding support.

*Result*:
ü§ñ GEMINI RESEARCH RESPONSE:

Claude Code Subagents are specialized AI assistants within Claude Code that can be used to handle specific tasks. They offer task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools, and separate context windows, which helps in efficient problem-solving.

**Key benefits of using subagents:**

*   **Context preservation:** Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives.
*   **Specialized expertise:** Subagents can be fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains, leading to higher success rates on designated tasks.
*   **Reusability:** Once created, subagents can be used across different projects and shared with your team for consistent workflows.
*   **Flexible permissions:** Each subagent can have different tool access levels, allowing you to limit powerful tools to specific subagent types.

**Setting up and initializing Claude Code Subagents:**

1.  **Open the subagents interface:** Run the command `/agents` in the Claude Code terminal.
2.  **Create a new agent:** Select "Create New Agent" and choose whether to create a project-level or user-level subagent.
3.  **Define the subagent:**
    *   Describe the subagent in detail and when it should be used.
    *   Select the tools you want to grant access to (or leave blank to inherit all tools).
    *   Customize the system prompt to guide its behavior.
4.  **Save and use:** Once saved, Claude will automatically call the agent when a task matches its description. You can also invoke a specific agent explicitly using a command (for example, ‚Äúuse the code reviewer subagent to check my recent changes‚Äù).

Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on the task description in your request, the description field in subagent configurations, current context, and available tools.

*Called tool*: gemini-mcp - gemini_research: 
    Ask Gemini a question and get a response grounded with Google Search results.
    This tool uses the new unified SDK with proper grounding support.
    
    Args:
        topic: The topic to research using Google Search grounding
    

*Parameters*:
  * topic: Claude Code Sub Agents YAML configuration format system prompt examples 2024

*Result*:
ü§ñ GEMINI RESEARCH RESPONSE:

It appears you're asking about how to configure Claude Code's sub-agents using YAML, including examples of system prompts. Here's a breakdown of how to do that, incorporating information from the search results:

**1. What are Sub-agents?**

*   Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that Claude Code can delegate tasks to.
*   They have specific expertise, their own context window, and can be configured with specific tools and a custom system prompt.
*   They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations.
*   Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on the task description, the description field in the sub-agent's configuration, and the current context and available tools.

**2. Configuration Files & Format**

*   Sub-agents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
*   These files can be located in two places:
    *   Project sub-agents: `.claude/agents/` (available only in the current project; highest priority).
    *   User sub-agents: `~/.claude/agents/` (available across all projects; lower priority).
*   When sub-agent names conflict, project-level sub-agents take precedence over user-level ones.

**3. YAML Frontmatter Structure**

Each sub-agent file follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---
Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach to solving problems. Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints the subagent should follow.
```

*   **`name`**:  The name of your sub-agent.
*   **`description`**: A description of when the sub-agent should be used. Claude Code uses this to determine when to delegate tasks.
*   **`tools`**: A comma-separated list of tools the sub-agent has access to. If omitted, the sub-agent inherits all tools from the main thread.  Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access interactively.
*   **System Prompt:**  This section defines the sub-agent's role, capabilities, and how it should approach problems. Include instructions, best practices, and constraints.

**4. Creating Sub-agents**

*   **Using the `/agents` command:** This is the recommended approach. It opens an interactive menu where you can:
    *   View all available sub-agents.
    *   Create new sub-agents with a guided setup.
    *   Edit existing sub-agents, including their tool access.
    *   Delete custom sub-agents.
    *   See which sub-agents are active.
    *   Manage tool permissions.
*   **Manually:** You can create the Markdown files manually.

**5. Example Sub-agent Configurations (with System Prompts)**

Here are a few examples of sub-agent configurations, combining information from the search results:

*   **Code Reviewer:**

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need a thorough, uncompromising review of code changes, particularly focusing on backward compatibility issues, unnecessary modifications, and functional consistencies.
tools: Read, Grep
---
You are a senior software engineering expert with decades of experience in enterprise systems API designs and maintaining large-scale code bases. You have zero tolerance for sloppy code, unnecessary changes, and backward compatibility breaks. Your reviews are known for being brutally honest, technically precise, and uncompromising in maintaining code quality.
```

*   **Test Runner:**

```yaml
---
name: test-runner
description: Run test suite, diagnose failures, and fix them while preserving test intent. Use PROACTIVELY after code changes.
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
Run "php artisan test" or "vendor/bin/pest". For failures: 1) Reproduce; 2) Isolate root cause; 3) Propose minimal fix with evidence (stack traces, diffs).
```

*   **Front-end Engineer (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI):**

```yaml
---
name: nextjs-tailwind-shadcn-engineer
description: Use this agent when you need to build, modify, or debug front-end components and applications using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---
You are an expert front-end engineer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.  Pay close attention to detail and follow best practices for performance and accessibility. Be mindful of user experience and create visually appealing and responsive designs.
```

*   **API Developer:**

```yaml
---
name: api-developer
description: Design and build developer-friendly APIs with proper documentation, versioning, and security. Specializes in REST, GraphQL, and API gateway patterns. Use PROACTIVELY for API-first development and integration projects.
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---
You are an API development specialist focused on creating robust, well-documented, and developer-friendly APIs. Create APIs that developers love to use. Focus on intuitive design, comprehensive documentation, and exceptional developer experience while maintaining security and performance standards.
```

**6. Key Considerations for System Prompts**

*   **Be Detailed:** Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints.
*   **Focused Sub-agents:** Design sub-agents with single, clear responsibilities.
*   **Limit Tool Access:** Only grant access to the tools necessary for the sub-agent's purpose.

**7. How Sub-agents are Invoked**

*   **Automatic Invocation:** Claude Code automatically delegates tasks based on the context and the sub-agent's description.
*   **Explicit Invocation:**  Mention the sub-agent by name in your request (e.g., "Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes").

By following these guidelines, you can effectively configure and utilize Claude Code sub-agents to streamline your development workflows.

# Claude Code Sub Agents: Complete Guide

Based on my research using both current web sources and specialized documentation, here's everything you need to know about Claude Code Sub Agents.

## What Are Claude Code Sub Agents?

Claude Code Sub Agents are **specialized AI assistants** that you can create for specific development tasks. Think of them as hiring a team of specialized developers, each with their own expertise area, tools, and working style.

### Key Benefits:
- **Context Preservation**: Each subagent operates in its own isolated context window
- **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tuned for specific domains with higher success rates
- **Reusability**: Can be used across different projects and shared with teams
- **Flexible Permissions**: Different tool access levels for each subagent

## How They Work

Sub Agents follow the **"mixture of experts"** approach - instead of one AI trying to do everything, you create specialized agents for specific tasks. Each subagent:

- Has its own **context window** (no more context switching issues)
- Operates with **custom system prompts**
- Has **specific tool permissions**
- Maintains **isolated focus** on their specialty

## Setup and Initialization

### Step 1: Access the Subagents Interface
```bash
/agents
```
This opens the interactive subagents management interface where you can view, create, and manage your agents.

### Step 2: Create Your First Subagent
1. Click "Create New Agent"
2. Choose between:
   - **Project-level**: Only available in current project (highest priority)
   - **User-level**: Available across all projects (lower priority)

### Step 3: Configure Your Subagent
- **Describe** when the subagent should be used
- **Select tools** to grant access (or leave blank to inherit all)
- **Customize** the system prompt to guide behavior

## Configuration Format

Sub Agents are stored as **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter**:

### File Locations:
- **Project sub-agents**: `.claude/agents/` (project-specific)
- **User sub-agents**: `~/.claude/agents/` (global)

### YAML Structure:
```yaml
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---
Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This defines the subagent's role, 
capabilities, and approach to solving problems.
```

## Example Subagent Configurations

### 1. Production Code Validator
```yaml
---
name: production-validator
description: Automatically reviews code for production readiness
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are my production code quality enforcer. Here's exactly what I care about:

**IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS:**
- TODO comments or FIXME notes
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Console.log statements
- Unhandled exceptions
- Missing error handling

**QUALITY CHECKS:**
- Code formatting and style consistency
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Documentation completeness
```

### 2. Code Reviewer
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use this agent when you need a thorough, uncompromising review of code changes
tools: Read, Grep
---

You are a senior software engineering expert with decades of experience in enterprise 
systems API designs and maintaining large-scale code bases. You have zero tolerance 
for sloppy code, unnecessary changes, and backward compatibility breaks. Your reviews 
are known for being brutally honest, technically precise, and uncompromising in 
maintaining code quality.
```

### 3. Frontend Engineer (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI)
```yaml
---
name: nextjs-tailwind-shadcn-engineer
description: Use this agent when you need to build, modify, or debug front-end components
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---

You are an expert front-end engineer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and 
Shadcn UI. Pay close attention to detail and follow best practices for performance 
and accessibility. Be mindful of user experience and create visually appealing and 
responsive designs.
```

### 4. Test Runner
```yaml
---
name: test-runner
description: Run test suite, diagnose failures, and fix them while preserving test intent
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

Run "php artisan test" or "vendor/bin/pest". For failures: 
1) Reproduce; 2) Isolate root cause; 3) Propose minimal fix with evidence 
(stack traces, diffs).
```

### 5. API Developer
```yaml
---
name: api-developer
description: Design and build developer-friendly APIs with proper documentation
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---

You are an API development specialist focused on creating robust, well-documented, 
and developer-friendly APIs. Create APIs that developers love to use. Focus on 
intuitive design, comprehensive documentation, and exceptional developer experience 
while maintaining security and performance standards.
```

## How Subagents Are Invoked

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code **automatically delegates** tasks based on:
- Task description in your request
- Subagent's description field
- Current context
- Available tools

### Explicit Invocation
You can call specific agents by name:
```
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Let the production-validator review this code"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Focused Specialization**
- Design each subagent with **single, clear responsibilities**
- Avoid overlap between agents
- Keep descriptions specific and actionable

### 2. **Tool Restriction**
- Only grant access to tools necessary for the subagent's purpose
- This enhances effectiveness and security
- Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access interactively

### 3. **Detailed System Prompts**
- Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints
- Be explicit about the subagent's role and approach
- Include best practices and quality standards

### 4. **Context Isolation**
- Each agent maintains its own focus
- No more unintentional context switching
- Specialists maintain their expertise area

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Team Coordination
The real power comes when multiple agents work together:
- **Frontend Specialist** + **Backend Architect** for full-stack development
- **Code Reviewer** + **Test Runner** for quality assurance
- **API Developer** + **Production Validator** for deployment readiness

### Workflow Automation
Combine subagents with Claude Code hooks for complete automation:
- Automatic code reviews on commits
- Production validation before deployment
- Test suite execution and failure diagnosis

## Troubleshooting and Limitations

### Common Issues:
1. **Agent not being invoked**: Check the description field matches your task
2. **Tool access problems**: Verify tool permissions in the `/agents` interface
3. **Context conflicts**: Ensure agents have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities

### Limitations:
- Subagents are stateless between invocations
- Each agent operates independently
- Tool access is limited to what's explicitly granted

## Getting Started Checklist

1. **Update Claude Code**: Ensure you have the latest version
2. **Run `/agents`**: Access the management interface
3. **Create your first agent**: Start with a simple, focused subagent
4. **Test the agent**: Try invoking it with a specific task
5. **Iterate and improve**: Refine the system prompt based on results
6. **Build your team**: Add more specialized agents as needed
